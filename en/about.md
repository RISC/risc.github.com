## About us

Founded in 1904, the Royal Ixelles Swimming Club (RISC) is located in the oldest indoor swimming pool in the Brussels-Capital Region. The latter is located in Ixelles, in a district previously called the "Verloren Hoek" (the "Lost corner").

After years spent in national division 3, a few down years have made the club drop into division 4. During the last few years, however, we have returned to the top of division 4, with a strong desire to regain a place in the upper division.
