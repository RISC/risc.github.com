After a long wait, here it is, at least, the new version of our website.

All this have started with the desire of the team to have a mascot, then we got the help of a talented designer who created a new logo, that we really like, for us.

The only thing left on the list was, after we changed the look of our Facebook page, to get a fresh look to the website.

This is now done.
Thanks for the wait, and happy browsing.
